### Here's how to run the project's development environment:

Start the backend service (Sunlight Service):
```sh
cd sunlight-service
npm run dev

```
In a new terminal, start the frontend app (Daylight App):
```sh
cd daylight-app
npm run dev
```
This will start:


The Vue.js frontend application (daylight-app) using Vite's development server


The TypeScript backend service (sunlight-service) in development mode
